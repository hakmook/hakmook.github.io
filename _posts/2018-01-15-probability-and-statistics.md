Before I started my biostatistics master at Vanderbilt University, I learned related probability knowledge pretty much in high school for mathematical contest. Luckily, it is very close to the interview problems like cards or coin-flip. However, starting to learn the fundamental concepts of probability and statistics is the key to analytics in data science field. 

Here I list a few resources as recommendation.

# [Statistical Inference Book - CB 2nd Version](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126)

This is the book I recommend everyone to read it first. It might be a little harder for people who just want to get the basics. Almost all the department of statistics in US have choosen this classic book for the first-year statistics graduate student.

Probability and Basic Statistics: Chapter 1-5

The following guideline is from Prof. Shepherd's website. No doubt this is one of the best courses I have ever taken at Vandy. One year later, I was happy to be his TA and had a lot of insights from my biostatistics students.

Hypothesis Testing: Chapter 6-12

The rest half of CB book might be complicated for non-statistics people. Our professor Jeffrey wrote a great lecture note and it is almost in press. I will update this info once he publishes his book in the future.

Instead, there are a lot of online resources from BU or PSU. The following is what I usually refer to.

# [MIT: Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/)

This is highly recommended for people who has time sitting down, listening lectures and taking notes. The recommended book above might be too formal or contains a lot of math. You can start to learn from [this course in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb). All the videos were recorded at 2003 and professor or TA wrote everything on the blackboard. For some reason, I like this traditional way because you can listen, stop and take notes in your own way. Taking notes is always the best way to learn, think and get memorized.

# [A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662)

After you have learned a lot of concepts in statistics and probablity, it is time to test yourself by the tricky interview questions. I know you can learn some of the interview questions from Quora or Glassdoor. Superisingly, I almost saw every concept summarized in this great book. A lot of my friends in Data Science called "green treasure book". For people who cares about probability and statistics, you can refer to Chapter 4. 

Also, this is a great book for people who prepared quantitative interview in the finance companies. Here are other good online videos you can check:
