# Motivation

I started to learn SQL from applying a summer internship and got a lot of exercises at AxialHealthcare. Briefly, for feature development regarding opioid use disorder, opioid addition and opioid relapse, I first read a lot of medical papers and applied these domain knowledge and well-established models, then extracted the wanted data from the database from GC and AWS. After getting the data, I analyzed it through Python or R and visualized by Tableau.

Before I had hands-on experience of MYSQL and PostgreSQL on cloud services, I went through several good online courses. Thanks to Lingjun Fu and Chaochen You, they gave me a lot of insights about where to rock SQL learning.

# Online Courses

* [Vertabelo Academy SQL module](https://academy.vertabelo.com/)

This is the best platform I would recommend it first. After registration, you can learn SQL from several modules like basics, creating tables and window functions. It explained well how to apply SQL in the real cases. What's more, it provided online practicing and hints. Each module took a lot of practice until you built up the confidence step by step. The following is what I have learned from this platform.

>SQL Basics (100% completed, 129/129)

>Operating on Data in SQL (100% completed, 19/19)

>Creating Tables in SQL (not purchased 8% completed, 15/177)

>Standard SQL Functions (100% completed, 211/211)

>Window Functions (100% completed, 218/218)

* [Intro to Database](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about)

This the mini course of Intro to Database from Stanford online course. By the time, I did not review the complete course. If you have enough time, I would recommend you go through the complete course and it will give you a comprehensive understanding of databases including SQL and non-SQL. For mini course of SQL, I like homework after you learned some functions about SQL. The homework is based on a network context. I have posted my solution on the Github if you need a hand.

# Online Judgement

After completing the courses above, it is time to test yourself at two popular online judgement platforms.

*[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

*[Leetcode DataBase](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/)

The following is my solution for Leetcode problems. Some are really treaky. If you find yourself struggling, don't be frustrated and learn from the posted dicussion.
